                                        <td>Early Remington "And They're Wetproof" cardboard display sign. It has good color with a great image of customer purchasing a firearm and ammunition at a counter. It shows some wear, discoloration, creases, and some paper loss. There is some restoration throughout with the most notable being a vertical crease in the center. These are almost always missing the tabs but this example does have them and two are missing the top layer. It displays well and is a hard piece to find. Shrink wrapped and secured to foam board. Marked Printed In U.S.A. 20.5" H x 28" W. CONDITION: 7.75.</td>
