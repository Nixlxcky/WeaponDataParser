It shows some wear, spots of discoloration, paper loss, and some folds/creases. It appears that it has come apart at the fold marks and it has been mounted put back together on a piece of foam board. It displays exceptionally well and the sign would look even better framed.  Sign. 40.25" H x 60" W. CONDITION: 8.</td>
