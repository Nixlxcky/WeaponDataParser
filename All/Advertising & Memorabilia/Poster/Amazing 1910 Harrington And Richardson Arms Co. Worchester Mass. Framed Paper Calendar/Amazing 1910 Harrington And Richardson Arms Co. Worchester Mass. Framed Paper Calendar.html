                                        <td>1910 Harrington and Richardson framed paper calendar sign. It has excellent color and shows light wear with some very small spots of restoration done throughout, mainly above where the calendar pad would go. There is a correct 1910 pad framed with it as well but we are not sure if it is complete. It displays exceptionally well in a newer frame that shows light wear. It retains both original metal bands at the top and bottom. Marked Copyright, 1909, By Harrington & Richardson Arms Co. Sign. 41.75" H x 21.5" W. CONDITION: 8.9.</td>
