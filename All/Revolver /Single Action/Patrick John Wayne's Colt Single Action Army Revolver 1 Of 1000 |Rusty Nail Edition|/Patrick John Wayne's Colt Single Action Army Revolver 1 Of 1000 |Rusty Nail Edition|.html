                                        <td>Third generation SAA, manufactured in 1981, previously owned by Patrick John Wayne, son of John Wayne. Single line company address on top of the barrel. Patent dates, in gen three fashion, are laser engraved in gold on the left side of the frame along with the rampant Colt pony. The left side of the barrel reads "God created man, Col. Colt made them equal", while the right reads "Colt Single Action Army .44-40 Cal.", all in gold etching. The left side of the frame has "1 of 1000" in gold inlay. Frame has two laser etched pictures of Samuel Colt. His signature is also laser engraved in gold inlay on the backstrap. Plenty of gold inlay throughout, all over a dark Colt blue custom shop finish. Factory checkered black plastic grips. Includes an additional fully blued, non-engraved .44-40 cylinder. Includes the original Colt box with matching custom shop label, original invoice from Colt to Michael Wayne (oldest son) and original manual/paperwork. When this gun was originally sold, it included a wood display case and "rusty nail" taken from the Colt Armorer's house during its restoration in the 1990's, hence the "rusty nail" designation. No display case or nail is included with this gun, but it does include a signed letter from Patrick Wayne, stating his prior ownership. CONDITION: Metal retains 98% + of its original finish with no signs of handling or use. Grips are excellent. Bore is bright with strong rifling. Appears to be unfired from the factory. Tight hammer, cylinder, and crisp mechanics. No drag line. Extra cylinder is excellent with no signs of use. Box is very good overall with light corner/edge wear. End label has been taped. CALIBER: .44-40. FFL STATUS: Modern. S/N: SA53631.</td>
