Eventually acquired by the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, it was auctioned at their fundraising gala in 1991. The museum commissioned master engraver Alvin White to engrave and embellish this extraordinary SAA. It was the first of approximately ten revolvers to be offered at the annual fundraiser auctions over the next decade and can be seen in The Colt Engraving Book, Volume Two by R.L Wilson. Standard model markings on the left side of the barrel with the company address on top. Typical patent dates and rampant Colt. All markings, minus the "VP" proof, are in gold inlay. Barrel has a gold inlaid image of the museum building on the left side and "Annual Gala/Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum" etched on the right. Gold inlay "10 gallon" Stetson on the right cylinder in addition to a silver inlay cowboy and rampant horse. The revolver features a "1" in gold inlay over the serial number, identifying it as the first to be sold in the museum's gala. Â 7-1/2" barrel with blade front sight and u-notch rear. Six shot fluted cylinder. Fine floral/scroll engraving and gold inlay throughout by Alvin White. Dark blued finish and mother of pearl style grips.

Includes a custom leather case by Arno Werner, chief bookbinder for rare editions at Harvard University's Houghton Library. CONDITION: Metal retains 99% of its original finish. No real signs of use or handling. Grips are excellent. Bore is clean overall with strong rifling. Tight hammer and cylinder. No drag line on the cylinder. Display box is excellent. CALIBER: .45 COLT.
