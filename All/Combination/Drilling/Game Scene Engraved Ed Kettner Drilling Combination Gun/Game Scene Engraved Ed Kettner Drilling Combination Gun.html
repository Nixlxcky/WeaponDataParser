Standard commercial proofs. 26-3/4" blued steel barrels with blade front sight and flip up u-notch rear. Rifle appears to be .43 caliber (should be chamber cast to verify).

Tang safety and double set triggers. Replaced forearm and butt stock with fine cut checkering on both. Carved cheek piece on the right side of the butt. Checkered metal butt plate. Bores appear to measure at full/full. LOP: 13-1/2". CONDITION: Metal is good overall. Barrels are beginning to form a gray patina. About 50% finish remaining. Lock has wear and some signs of cleaning. Some finish from the wood has found its way onto the lock plates. Wood has minor scuffs and scratches. Forearm has putty on the inside for proper fit but has some "slide". Shotgun bores have light pits. Rifle bore has a frosted surface. Some pits near the chamber. Good overall rifling. Tang safety does not seem to be working. Hammers and action are both tight. CALIBER: 16 Gauge & .43 CAL. FFL STATUS: Curio & Relic. S/N: 509.</td>
