                                        <td>Very few of these were manufactured during their roughly two year production of 1969-1971. Standard post 64 style markings on the receiver and barrel. 19" barrel with hooded factory front blade sight and buckhorn u-notch rear. Original blued finish and jeweled bolt. Simmons scope bases attached to the receiver. Factory gloss finished walnut full Mannlicher stock with fine cut checkering on the wrist and forearm. Right hand check piece on the left side of the butt stock. Factory sling studs and black checkered rubber butt pad. Includes serial matching box with manual in the inside. This is a very scarce gun that would be an excellent addition to any collection. CONDITION: Very fine with about 98% factory finish remaining. Wood has a few light handling marks and scratches. Bore is bright with strong rifling. Mechanically fine. Box has edge wear and a corner tear but very good otherwise. CALIBER: .243 Winchester. FFL STATUS: Modern. S/N: G935665.</td>
