                                        <td>This attractive pair once belonged to Sir Robert Stevenson Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan. Horne (1871-1940) was a Scottish businessman and politician best known for serving under David Lloyd George as the Minister Of Labour (1919-1920), president of the Board Of Trade (1920-1921) and Chancellor of the Exchequer (1921-1922). He also was connected as the Director of many private companies including the Suez Canal Company and Great Western Railway Company. He was ennobled as Viscount Horne of Slamannan in 1937. The guns themselves were manufactured circa 1904/05 and sport 30" side by side dovetailed barrels with bead front sights. Narrow, swamped ribs with a "1" and "2" in gold inlay on each respective barrel. Each lever and forearm are numbered "1" and "2" with the forearm numbers on the underside not in gold inlay. London nitro proofs on the underside of each chamber. "(Crown)/V" proofs on each water table. Each barrel is marked "HOLLAND & HOLLAND" on the top of the right barrel and "98. NEW BOND STREET LONDON" on the left. Case colored sidelock frames with both sides of each marked "HOLLAND AND HOLLAND" while the underside of each is marked "ROYAL/HAMMERLESS EJECTOR". Each frame has beautiful scroll engraving, known as "Royal Pattern" engraving. "PATENT/SINGLE TRIGGER" is engraved on each trigger plate and "PATENT/EJECTOR" on the middle of each lever, which both sport engraved blued finishes. Serial numbers engraved on each trigger guard in addition to being found on the water tables, forearms and on the underside of each barrel. European walnut stocks and forearms. Straight grip butts with fine cut checkering on the wrist and forearms. "R.S.H" in gold ovals on the toe lines. Ribbed, horn butt plates. Single triggers and sliding tang safety. 2-1/2" chambers. Both barrels have left side improved cylinder and right side cylinder choke bores. Bore diameters are all .730". Barrel wall thickness is .023" on both barrels of Gun A. Gun B has a barrel wall thickness of .024" on the left barrel and .022" on the right. LOP: 14-1/4" on each with a cast off of about 2". Drop at comb is 1-9/16" on both. Drop at heel is roughly 2-1/2" on gun 1 and 2-3/16" on gun 2. This fine pair of guns present in a red cloth lined oak leather case with brass corners. Case is an original Holland & Holland and marked "SIR ROBERT HORNE" on the top. An oil bottle, two dummy rounds, period cleaning tools and brushes are all found on the inside. CONDITION: Very fine with some signs of refinish on the barrels. Case color on the frames is about 50% (original finish) with the barrels being about 85% (some light refinish). Wood has scattered handling marks and scratches with minor dents as well. Finish looks to be original. Bores are bright with no visible dents. Tight lock up. Ejectors appear to be strong. Case has exterior wear with some gouges to the leather. Straps and top handle have heavy wear/crazing but both are intact. CALIBER: 12 Gauge. FFL STATUS: Curio & Relic. S/N: Gun A) 23304, Gun B) 23305.</td>
